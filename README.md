# Validation Rules
 ### User Registration

- **Name:** 2-50 characters  
- **Email:** Valid email  
- **Password:** Minimum 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character  
- **Role:** admin, subadmin, teamhead, agent  
- **Phone:** 10-digit number (optional)  
- **teamHeadId:** Required if role is agent  
- **Status:** active / inactive (default active)

### User Update

- **Admin:** Can update any field for any user  
- **Subadmin / Teamhead / Agent:** Can update only themselves, allowed fields: name, phone, password  
- **Cannot update:** email, role, status, teamHeadId, other users  

### Login

- **Email:** Required, must be valid  
- **Password:** Required  

### Security Features

- Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt**  
- JWT-based authentication  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Input validation with **Joi**

### Testing

- **Roles:** Admin, Subadmin, Teamhead, and Agent can be tested with separate JSON payloads.  
- **API Behavior:** All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for unauthorized, invalid, or forbidden requests.  
- **Security Testing:** Includes attempts to bypass RBAC, XSS injection, invalid roles, and updating restricted fields.

### Notes

- Only Admin can manage users fully, including roles and status.  
- Subadmin and Teamhead can view users based on assigned scope.  
- Agents have minimal privileges.  
- Developer secret allows internal registration of agents.

I can also **create a super clean “Postman-ready JSON collection”** for all endpoints, including Admin, Subadmin, Teamhead, and Agent testing.
